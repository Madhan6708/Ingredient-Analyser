Technologies Used:
✔️ Python
✔️ OpenCV (for camera & image processing)
✔️ Pytesseract (for OCR text extraction)
✔️ OpenPyXL (to read harmful ingredient dataset)
✔️ Wikipedia API (for ingredient definitions)
✔️ Streamlit (to build the web interface)






How It Works?:
1️⃣ Select input method: 'Capture from Camera' or 'Upload Image'
2️⃣ If 'Capture from Camera' is selected, the live camera feed appears
3️⃣ Clicking 'Capture Image' stops the camera and saves the image
4️⃣ Extracted text from the image is displayed
5️⃣ The system checks for harmful ingredients in the dataset
6️⃣ Unsafe ingredients are flagged with warnings and definitions
7️⃣ If no harmful ingredients are found, the product is marked SAFE ✅
